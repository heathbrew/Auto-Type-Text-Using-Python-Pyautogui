# Auto-Type-Text-Using-Python-Pyautogui
Want to learn how to auto-type text using Python? Copy-pasting is not a cool way to imitate typing of a text file. What would you think if some python script can imitate actual human-like typing of text from a keyboard? By typing, I mean to refer to actual typing, letter by letter and word by word in any input field, chatbox, etc.
